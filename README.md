# South-Africa-Language-Detection

South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society.

The country is multilingual with 11 official languages, each of which is guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual and able to speak at least two or more of the official languages. With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that our systems and devices also communicate in multi-languages!
 
I have trained a classification model to predict in which South African language a piece of text is written in.
